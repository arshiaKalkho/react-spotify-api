# react-spotify-api

this was a part of the silver-fox project but for secutiry reasons had to be seperated into int's own repo. uses spotify api to load song titles, names and images.

to run it:

add .env file in the root of your project(or env var to host server) and then give them names REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT and REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_SECRET
give them your own api client and secret as values.
