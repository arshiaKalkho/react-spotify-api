# react-spotify-api
this was a part of the silver-fox project but for secutiry reasons had to be seperated into int's own repo. uses spotify api to load song titles, names and images.



create file:

Credentials.js

const Credentials = () => {

    return {ClientId: 'ADDYOUROWN',
    ClientSecret: 'ADDYOUROWN'   
        //api keys are removed again
    }
}

export { Credentials};
